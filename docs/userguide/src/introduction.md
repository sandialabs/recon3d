`recon3d` is a collection of tools developed at Sandia National Laboratories for reconstruction of finite element discretizations from a 3D stack of images (often experimental x-ray Computed Tomography data). Choose either a *client installation* or a *developer installation*.

- The [**Client Installation**](./installation.md#client-installation) is recommended for users in an analyst role, who will **use** the **recon3d** functionality in an analysis workflow.  Knowledge of the Python programming language is not necessary.

- The [**Developer Installation**](./installation.md#developer-installation) is recommended for users in the developer role, who will **create** or **update** functionality.  Knowledge of the Python programming language is required.
